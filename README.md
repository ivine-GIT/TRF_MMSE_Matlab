# TRF_MMSE_Matlab
Estimate the auditory attention using sequential LMMSE

This repository contains MATLAB code used to infer the auditory attention using linear-MMSE estimator. It contains the following files:

	run_main_file.m : The main script
  
	seq_LMMSE.m : Implementation of sequential LMMSE
  
	getData.m : reads the EEG and speech data
  
	getMarker.m : An interpolation script
  
  
The repository contains an EEG file (sample_EEG.mat) and a speech envelope folder. The experiment and data collection procedures are described in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9175866
